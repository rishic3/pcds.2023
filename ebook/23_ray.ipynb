    "## Ray: Task Programming with Remote Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at cloud programming tools geared towards data parallel applications driven by a data decomposition. Data decomposition matches the data science, groupby analysis workloads of Internet/cloud data processing, such as processing logs, crawling and indexing the Web. However, \"modern AI\" applications have different demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper [Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05889.pdf) takes a different approach. The abstract is confusing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The next generation of AI applications will continuously\n",
    "interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding\n",
    "systems requirements, both in terms of performance and\n",
    "flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements\n",
    "and present Ray—a distributed system to address them.\n",
    "Ray implements a unified interface that can express both\n",
    "task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by\n",
    "a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the performance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler\n",
    "and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the\n",
    "system’s control state.\n",
    "\n",
    "All one really gets out of this is that it is a distributed task/actor programming model.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Task Parallelism__: the decomposition of a program into tasks that can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen this concept with OpenMP in which tasks are equal to basic blocks or blocks of loop iterations.  We also saw this in the work/span lecture and problems in which each function call is a task. For Ray, functions will be tasks. So, parallelism will be defined on a per function basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actor based__: we will cover this in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "> They must aim not only to exploit the data gathered, but also to explore the space of possible actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> These characteristics drive new systems requirements:\n",
    "a system for RL must support fine-grained computations\n",
    "(e.g., rendering actions in milliseconds when interacting\n",
    "with the real world, and performing vast numbers of simulations), must support heterogeneity both in time (e.g.,\n",
    "a simulation may take milliseconds or hours) and in resource usage (e.g., GPUs for training and CPUs for simulations), and must support dynamic execution, as results of simulations or interactions with the environment can change future computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses reinforcement learning as the singular motivation. It's a good and important example. However, the generality of the framework does not match the specificity of the motivating application. "
