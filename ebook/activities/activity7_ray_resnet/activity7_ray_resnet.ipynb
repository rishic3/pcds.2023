    "This is a short exercise to demonstrate how actors can communicate through remote oids.\n",
    "We are going to break the actors of the ImageNet classification [Example 24](../../examples/24_ex_ray_actors.ipynb) into \n",
    "two actors: one that transforms the image into an ResNet50 compatible tensor and one that takes\n",
    "the tensor as input and returns the classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given two class files that have been written to be instantiated as Ray actors:\n",
    "  * [rayresnet50_normalize](./rayresnet50_normalize.py)\n",
    "  * [rayresnet50_classify](./rayresnet50_classify.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the exercise you need to populate the following driver code.  Then answer the questions.\n",

    "Data is from https://github.com/EliSchwartz/imagenet-sample-images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: check your ouput to make sure that the predictions match the input file. This classifier should be over 90% correct. You need to be careful to match the return OIDs with files. **Include the cell output in submitted notebook**."

    "\n",
    "* Question 1: Does the computation for a single input file (normalization and classification) run in serial or parallel?  If serially, how is the dependency enforced?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 2: Does the computation of different files run in serial or parallel?  If parallel, explain why they are independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 3: Your computation needs to collect return identifiers for the classification objects. It is not necessary to collect the OIDs of the normalization function in the driver code. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 4: At any given point in time, how many actors are running and what are they doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 5: Is this implementation faster or slower than doing the normalization and classification in one actor?  Can you think of a situation in which it would be faster to do them together?  (By situation, I mean data properties or target hardware system on which this would be preferable.) "
