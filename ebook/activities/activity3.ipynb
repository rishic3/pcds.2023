    "The code uses a combination of Cilk's cilk_for and SIMD intrinsics to process chunks of 32 bytes at once. For each 32-byte chunk, it checks for adjacent bytes matching the target. This is done by creating a mask where each byte matches the target, shifting this mask by one byte, and then performing a logical AND to identify adjacent matches. Using pop count (_mm_popcnt_u32), the code counts the number of found pairs in the current chunk. For the boundary case, the code checks if a pair is split between the current chunk and the next chunk by comparing the last byte of the current chunk with the first byte of the next chunk. After the main vectorized loop, a scalar loop handles any bytes not processed in the 32-byte chunks.  \n",

    "*How many cycles does it take?*  \n",
    "Data load: 7 cycles  \n",
    "Byte comparison to create mask: 1 cycle  \n",
    "Byte shift left for adjacent match: 1 cycle  \n",
    "Logical AND for finding adjacent matches: 1 cycle  \n",
    "Extracting high bits from the mask: 3 cycles  \n",
    "Counting number of pairs using popcount: 2 cycles  \n",
    "Boundary check between chunks (scalar operations): ~10 cycles (estimated)  \n",

    "*How many iterations of the base loop does it compute on each iteration?*  \n",
    "In each iteration of the vectorized loop, the code processes 32 bytes at once, and since it looks for pairs, it is effectively processing 31 potential pairs. This means it covers 31 iterations of the original loop in each iteration of the vectorized loop.\n"
